My favorite uncle at his gorgeous Christmas dinner. Can I use yours? Well, that's very flattering, but I'm a little busy with that. 5, 6, 7, 8. Oops. Oops. Oops. It's gonna be huge. I'm gonna text it to myself. Okay. Well, thank you. We're in. Bring the line. Oh, do Lily next. I'm worried she's vaping. Dad? What are you doing over here by yourself? Are you okay? I'm worried this looking manny thing will affect me and Gloria at work. We've been having such a great time. I call us Chica and the man. Dad, I have to tell you something. Tell him what? How? Hey, everybody. Look who's friends again. That's right. Luke's gonna paint Sherry. Manny's okay. Problem solved, farm style. Sorry about that. Back home when someone would yell farm style, we'd all moo together. It's a sign of good breeding. Anyway, come. Sit. Sit. Let's go. You wanna know, Gloria. This is good news. Disloyalty being rewarded? Disloyalty? Really? Dad, I caught Gloria interviewing for a job with another realtor. What? Chica. How could you?
